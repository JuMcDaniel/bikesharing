# Citibike bike sharing analysis

## Technology for project

The data was manipulated using Python in Jupyter Notebooks to change datatypes and improve data for ease of visualization.  The data was then uploaded and visualized using Tableau Public.

Overview:
  The purpose of this data visualization project is to determine the key areas that bikesharing is performed in NYC and to determine if it is somehting that would transfer well to a smaller city i.e. Des Moines, Iowa.  
  The data that was collected determined the peak times for people to grab a bike are before and after work.  from the map is seems that the busiest drop off and pick up stations are by subway stops.  It seems that people especially college students due to the pick up spots at NYU being busy take the bikes from campus to their subway stop.

Who will rent to bikes?

  From this data is seems that men are more likely to rent the bikes than women.  This data can be used in a couple different ways.  Firstly we can do census studies to determine the amount of men who live in downtown Des Moines since more are more likely to use the service.  Also, we have to take into account the fact that this data is from downtown New York City, which is a very dangerous area to be riding a bike.  Men are more likely to be risk takers with riding a bike than women, and women tend to value their life more and would rather walk for safety. 
  
  
 Overall this is a valid product and has good success rates.  The biggest future analysis that would need to be performed would be on the data from a parallel city.  Comparing success in NYC is not going to translate to Des Moines, Iowa.  Changing the data set for a city where the project is successful with a less downtown and subway system would be the best option.  Also, determining a cost per ride to determine potential cost ratio with repairs of the bikes.  Also charing the same as New York in Des Moines again would not go over well.  This a great idea to get the community more active; however have to analyze with improved data sets.
